# App introduction

The App was actually more hard than I think because I had stucked on getting acces_token , building recentlyPlayed section , fetching tracks , albums , images and so on. Eventually I have built app even if it is a bit simple. By using the app you will able to get your playlists and tracks , recently played musics, Of course as the first step you have to login your spotify account. The only problem is that when page reloads or refreshes information lose. Then you have to log out and login your account again
